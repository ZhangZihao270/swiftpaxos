=== Baseline Performance Summary ===

Throughput (ops/sec):
  Min:    
  Max:    
  Avg:     ± 

Strong Latency (ms):
  Median:  -  (avg:  ± )
  P99:     -  (avg:  ± )

Weak Latency (ms):
  Median:  -  (avg:  ± )
  P99:     -  (avg:  ± )

✗ Weak median latency constraint VIOLATED (>= 2ms)

=== Target Analysis ===
Current baseline:   ops/sec
Target throughput: 23000 ops/sec
Gap:                ops/sec (+% needed)

=== Recommendations ===
Gap is small (<20%). Recommended approach:
  1. Fine-tune existing parameters (maxDescRoutines, SHARD_COUNT)
  2. Increase client threads slightly (2 clients × 3 threads)
