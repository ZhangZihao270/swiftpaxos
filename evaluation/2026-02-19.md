**Peak throughput: 70,388 ops/sec** at 128 threads/client (384 total)

## Summary

- **Peak throughput**: CURP-HO (71,595) and CURP-HT (70,388) achieve comparable peak throughput.
- **Scalability**: CURP-HT scales more linearly (roughly doubling with each thread doubling from 2 to 32). CURP-HO has non-monotonic scaling with dips at 4 and 16 threads due to sporadic slow-path fallbacks.
- **Strong latency**: Both protocols have similar strong-op median latency (~51ms at low load, matching the 50ms RTT). At high load, strong median rises to ~95-100ms (CURP-HO) and ~59ms (CURP-HT).
- **Weak latency (low load)**: CURP-HO has excellent weak median latency (0.19ms at 2 threads) with sub-1ms P99. CURP-HT weak median is also low (0.17ms) but has a persistent ~104ms W-P99 tail from slow-path fallback.
- **Weak latency (high load)**: At 128 threads, CURP-HT weak P99 spikes to 1,050ms. CURP-HO weak P99 stays at 208ms — better tail behavior under saturation.
- **CURP-HO advantage**: Better weak-op P99 at all load levels. Sub-1ms weak P99 at low load vs ~104ms for CURP-HT.
- **CURP-HT advantage**: More predictable throughput scaling and lower strong-op latency under high load.
